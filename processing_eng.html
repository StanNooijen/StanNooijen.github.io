        <p1>project 1</p1>
        <p1>in this project i made tried to make the ghost from mario but somethings did not work out. so i made a
            waving white kurby.</p1>
        <p1>it was hard to make the mouth because you had to get the points to connect the lines at a specific place but it did not work out that good.</p1>
        <p1>i did learn how to work with the colors and how to get the easy shapes at the good size and place.</p1>

        <p1>project 2</p1>
        <p1>in this project i made a cheap version of paint.</p1>
        <p1>it was very easy because those are just buttons to change the color of your pen and shape nothing special we had to add.</p1>

        <p1>project 3</p1>
        <p1>WARNING EPILEPTIC VIDEO</p1>
        <p1>In the project we had to make a moving screen saver. as you can see i made a very flashy screen saver.</p1>
        <p1>and i had the most fun with this project.</p1>
        <p1>its was hard to get the right up and down movement of the it because it was or to high and to low or the other way around.</p1>
        <p1>the easy thing was the color change because it was just that it could change in a specific range of the color numbers.</p1>
