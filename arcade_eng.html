        <div class="card-body"style="text-align: left;">In this project is made with one another student from software development and two other
            students who made the art. in this project we made a endless runner game. in the game ur character was
            running to the right and he goes faster and faster every second. in the game there are also 3 time zones. if
            u got in a other time zone u had to change ur character to that time zone to avoid getting busted by the
            cops in the time zone. there are 2 ways to lose the game. the first one is if u get caught 3 times. the
            second time is if u touch the red portals. the biggest problem was that we didn't have enough time to add
            every thing we wanted to add or somethings we added didn't work.</div>
