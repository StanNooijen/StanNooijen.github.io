        <p1>this project is made with one another student from software development and two other students who made the art.</p1>
        <p1>in this project we made a endless runner game. in the game ur chracter was running to the right and he goes faster and faster every second.</p1>
        <p1>in the game there are also 3 time zone. if u got in a other time zone u had to change to that time zone to avoid getting busted by the cops in the time zone.</p1>
        <p1>if u were busted 3 time u lose the game. there was also an other way to lose the game and that is if u hit the red portals</p1>
