        <p1>this project is made with one another student from software development and two other students who made the
            art.</p1>
        <p1>in this project we made a endless runner game. in the game ur character was running to the right and he goes
            faster and faster every second.</p1>
        <p1>in the game there are also 3 time zones. if u got in a other time zone u had to change ur character to that time zone to
            avoid getting busted by the cops in the time zone.</p1>
        <p1>there are 2 ways to lose the game. the first one is if u get caught 3 times. the second time is if u touch the red portals.</p1>
        <p1>the biggest problem was that we didn't have enough time to add every thing we wanted to add or somethings we added didn't work.</p1>
